      </h3>       
      
      <br />
{/* PROGRAM STATEMENT */}
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-1">Situation</h3>
      <p className="text-md leading-relaxed mb-2">
Due to a limitation in a legacy PayPal integration, refunds for orders older than 180 days would silently fail, leaving customers without reimbursement and agents without visibility into the failure. This resulted in prolonged resolution times (7‚Äì14 days), excessive touch points, inefficient escalations, duplicate refund attempts, elevated customer dissatisfaction, and revenue loss‚Äîcreating operational inefficiencies, eroding customer trust during critical support moments, and technical debt.

<h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-1">Program Scope and Goals</h3>
<ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-md opacity-80 space-y-1">
        <li>Refund customers in a timely manner: &lt; 1 business day</li> 
        <li>Reduce resolution time from 1-2 weeks to &lt; 2 hours</li>  
        <li>Reduce # of touchpoints/interactions between customer and agent</li> 
        <li>Eliminate errors and unnecessary escalations</li> 
        <li>Create a streamlined process that addresses customer issue, validates refund failure, documents and logs refund failure, and prepares refund in one step</li>  
        <li>Align with Finance and Account Management to reconcile funds from vendor</li>  
      </ul>
      <br />

{/* PROGRAM SCOPE AND GOAL */}
<h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-1">Design, Build, and Testing</h3>
  <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-md opacity-80 space-y-1">
      <li><a className="font-black">Root Cause Discovery</a>: Analyzed customer complaints and internal logs to confirm refund failures were linked to a PayPal API limitation.</li>  <li><a className="font-black">Process Design and Workflow Mapping</a>: Designed a lightweight, streamlined workflow that addresses and resolves customer issue in a single message; and confirms the refund failure, submits the refund, and logs all relevant details in a few steps.</li>
      <li><a className="font-black">Build & Tooling</a>: Developed a lightweight, no-code form that allowed agents to submit validated failures, which were automatically logged into a centralized database. This became the single source of truth for the program and supported Finance&#39;s responsibility to recover funds and push for HyperWallet integration.
      </li> 
      <li><a className="font-black">Testing & Iteration</a>: Soft launch with a small group of agents. Gathered feedback to refine the form structure, error handling, and agent instructions. Simplified input fields, clarified edge cases, and confirmed the process aligned with Finance‚Äôs requirements.</li>  
    </ul>

            {/* TIMELINE */}
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-1">Timeline (from Discovery to Launch)</h3>
      <LightboxImage src="/viz/gantt.png" alt="PayPal Workflow" /> <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-md opacity-80 space-y-1 mt-2">
        <li>Program needed to be deployed immediately, without disruption Support Operations</li> 
        <li>Program was in production for 16+ months, processing and recovering $250K+</li> 
      </ul>
      <br />
<LightboxImage  src="/viz/paypal-flow-before.png" alt="PayPal Workflow"  />
 <p className="text-md leading-relaxed mt-2">
        Before program:
      </p>
 <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-md opacity-80 space-y-1">
        <li>Average resolution time: ~7-14 days</li> 
        <li>Touchpoints per ticket: 10‚Äì20+, often with escalations and back-and-forth across teams</li> 
        <li>CSAT for these tickets: significantly below average, often accompanied by frustration and lost trust</li>
        <li>In some cases, Support team in France processed double refunds in error, requiring our team to reach out to customers and request them to return the duplicate refund‚Äîwhich created an awful customer experience</li>
      </ul>
<br/>
<LightboxImage src="/viz/paypal-flow-after.png" alt="PayPal Workflow"  />
 <p className="text-md leading-relaxed mt-2">
        After program:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-md opacity-80 space-y-1">
        <li>Average resolution time: &lt; 1 hour</li> 
        <li>Average refund time: &lt; 1 business day</li> 
        <li>Touchpoints per ticket: Reduced by 95%+</li> 
        <li>First response time: Reduced by 75%+. What was once a high-effort edge case became a low-hanging fruit for agents.</li> 
        <li>CSAT for these tickets: consistently 85%+, with significant improvement to customer trust</li>
        <li>Eliminated errors (duplicate payments) and the need for escalation</li>
        <li>Payments processed by team were recovered by Finance from vendors per payout period</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-1">Key metrics after program launch</h3>
<LightboxImage  src="/viz/kpi_after_dashboard.png" alt="KPI Results"  /><br /> 
<h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-1">Results</h3>
<ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-md opacity-80 space-y-1">
        <li><a className="font-black">Discovery and data analysis</a>. Investigated refund-related tickets and PayPal transaction logs to identify systemic failure points. Quantified the financial impact and mapped user pain points across the CX journey.

</li> 
        <li><a className="font-black">Process design and workflow mapping</a>. Designed a step-by-step internal process to detect, confirm, and recapture failed PayPal refunds. The workflow balanced technical accuracy (API validation) with operational simplicity.</li>  
        <li><a className="font-black">Form and workflow creation</a>. Built a no-code internal form for agents to flag failed PayPal refunds, log transactions, and notify the right leads‚Äîminimizing touch points, escalations, and reducing resolution time.</li> 

      </ul>
      <br />
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-1">Challenges</h3>
<ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-md opacity-80 space-y-1">
        <li><a className="font-black">Agent enablement</a>. Training them to learn another process and read API response logs.</li> 
        <li><a className="font-black">Process friction and context-switching</a>. Building a new workflow that minimized human error and was easy to adopt‚Äîwithout slowing down daily operations‚Äîwas a major priority.</li>  
        <li><a className="font-black">Customer dissatisfaction and eroded trust</a>. Long refund delays made customers distrust the platform, and agents were often left without the right information and tools. I needed to empower the front line quickly with a solution that built confidence and trust on both sides.</li> 
        <li><a className="font-black">Cross-functional ambiguity</a>. Payments, Finance, and CX all had partial ownership, which made accountability somewhat unclear.</li> 
        <li><a className="font-black">Lack of engineering resources</a>. There were no engineering resources available at the time, so the solution had to be lightweight, no-code, and deployable immediately.</li>  
        <li><a className="font-black">Scalability</a>. As the business scaled exponentially, I needed to ensure the solution could handle increasing volume‚Äîor be robust enough to influence a longer-term fix.</li> 
        <li><a className="font-black">Delayed HyperWallet Rollout</a>. Although HyperWallet integration was initially projected within the year, shifting priorities delayed it nearly two years. The interim process needed to be sustainable and trusted during this long gap.</li> 
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-1">Responsibilities</h3>
<ul className="list-disc ml-6 text-md opacity-80 space-y-1">
        <li><a className="font-black">Discovery and data analysis</a>. Investigated refund-related tickets and PayPal transaction logs to identify systemic failure points. Quantified the financial impact and mapped user pain points across the CX journey.
</li>

        <li><a className="font-black">Knowledge Base and training material</a>. Created agent-facing documentation with clear SOPs, troubleshooting guidance, and refund handling examples. Also created enablement decks and led live training sessions.
</li> 
        <li><a className="font-black">Soft launch</a>. Released the workflow to team leads and a pilot group of agents. Collected qualitative feedback, identified friction points, and iterated quickly to refine usability before full rollout.
</li>  
        <li><a className="font-black">Full launch</a>. Rolled out the process across the CX team. Established team norms, escalations paths, and a daily operational rhythm to ensure smooth execution at scale.
</li> 
        <li><a className="font-black">Ongoing monitoring</a>. Built a lightweight tracking method to monitor flagged refunds, processing status, and merchant recapture performance. Used weekly reviews to optimize efficiency.
</li> 
        <li><a className="font-black">Alignment with Finance and Account Management</a>. Partnered with Finance to ensure failed refunds were reconciled with vendors. Also worked with Account Management to inform vendors of systemic refund failures and the new recovery process that will be deducted from their payouts.
</li>
